# Wedding Planner To-Do App

This SwiftUI app helps manage wedding-related tasks leading up to the big day. It provides task creation, progress tracking, and local notifications for reminders.

## Features

- Add tasks with an optional due date
- Receive local notifications before a task is due
- View completion progress across all tasks
- Starter tasks are pre-filled for convenience

## Building

Create a new SwiftUI app project in Xcode 15 or later and copy the contents of the `WeddingPlanner` folder into the project. Run on iOS 17 or newer. All data is stored locally using `UserDefaults`.
